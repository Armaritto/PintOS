    Creating a high-priority thread 2.
    Thread 2 should have just lowered its priority.
    Thread 2 should have just exited.
    Thread 2 now lowering priority.
    Thread 2 exiting.

    This thread should have priority 41.  Actual priority: 41.
    This thread should have priority 42.  Actual priority: 42.
    acquire2, acquire1 must already have finished, in that order.
    This should be the last line before finishing this test.
    acquire1: got the lock
    acquire1: done
    acquire2: got the lock
    acquire2: done
        Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens in the code:
        The main thread acquires a lock.
        It creates two higher-priority threads, acquire1 and acquire2, passing the lock as an argument to both threads.
        The main thread prints the expected priority of acquire1 and acquire2.
        The main thread releases the lock.
        The main thread prints a message indicating that acquire2 and acquire1 must have already finished, in that order.
        The main thread prints the last line before finishing the test.
        The acquire1 thread function is executed.
        It acquires the lock.
        It prints a message indicating that it got the lock.
        It releases the lock.
        It prints a message indicating that it is done.
        The acquire2 thread function is executed.
        It acquires the lock.
        It prints a message indicating that it got the lock.
        It releases the lock.
        It prints a message indicating that it is done.
        Note: The output assumes that the implementation of the threads.c file is correct and that the thread scheduling and priority donation mechanisms are functioning as intended.
